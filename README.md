Pebble-ChordMemo
================

A watch app based off my Pebble-Note. This app aims to set, store and display a song's chord progression for later viewing on the Pebble watch. This is to be used only as a quick reference during live performance. You should practice and remember your chords prior to the actual performance! :D
